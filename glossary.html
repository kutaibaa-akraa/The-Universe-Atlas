<dt id="abellcatalogue"><span class="orange">Abell catalogue</span> (A, ACO)</dt>
  <dd>A catalogue of 2712 <a href="#rich">rich clusters of galaxies</a> produced 
    by George Abell in 1958 from careful examination of the Palomar Sky Survey 
    plates. It was extended in 1989 by George Abell, Harold Corwin and Ron Olowin 
    to include an extra 1364 rich clusters in the far southern hemisphere not 
    covered by the original Palomar Sky Survey. It contains most of the richest 
    clusters of galaxies within 3 billion <a href="#light">light years</a>.</dd>

<dt id="absolute"><span class="orange">Absolute magnitude</span></dt>
  <dd>The <a href="#apparent">apparent magnitude</a> an object would have if placed 
    at a distance of exactly 10 <a href="#parsec">parsecs</a> (=32.6 <a href="#light">light 
    years</a>). A <a href="#supergiant">supergiant star</a> might have an absolute 
    magnitude of -8 whereas a dim <a href="#red">red dwarf</a> might have an absolute 
    magnitude of +16. The Sun has an absolute magnitude of +4.8 - about half way 
    between the two extremes.</dd>
<dt id="angular"><span class="orange">Angular Size</span></dt>
  <dd>The apparent size of an object expressed as an angle. It is measured in 
    degrees, minutes and seconds.</dd>
<dt id="apparent"><span class="orange">Apparent magnitude</span></dt>
  <dd>The system used to give the brightness of stars in the sky. Brighter stars 
    have lower numbers and dimmer stars have higher numbers. The dimmest objects 
    visible with giant telescopes have a magnitude of +30. A good portable telescope 
    might see down to magnitude +15. Binoculars can see down to magnitude +9 and 
    the faintest naked eye stars have a magnitude of +6. Very bright objects have 
    a negative magnitude, the brightest star has a magnitude of -1.4, the full 
    Moon has a magnitude of -12.7 and the noon Sun has a magnitude of -26.8.</dd>
<dt id="arcminute"><span class="orange">Arcminute</span> (')</dt>
  <dd>A measure for small angles. 1 arcminute = 1/60 degree.</dd>
<dt id="arcsecond"><span class="orange">Arcsecond</span> (&quot;)</dt>

  <dd>See <a href="#ob">OB association</a>.</dd>
<dt id="astronomicalunit"><span class="orange">Astronomical Unit</span> (AU)</dt>
  <dd>The average distance between the Earth and the Sun. It is equal to 149&nbsp;597&nbsp;871
    km. It is often used for distances in a solar system or for distances between 
    companion stars.</dd>
<dt id="Barnardcatalogue"><span class="orange">Barnard catalogue</span></dt>
  <dd>A catalogue of 349 dark nebulae north of declination -35∞ produced by E 
    Barnard in 1927.</dd>
<dt id="barredgalaxy"><span class="orange">Barred Galaxy</span></dt>
  <dd>A <a href="#galaxy">galaxy</a> with a bright central bar of stars.</dd>
<dt id="bayername"><span class="orange">Bayer name</span></dt>
  <dd>The combination of a Greek letter and the name of a 
    <a href="#constellation">constellation</a> (Alpha Centauri, Epsilon Orionis etc.)
    used to identify bright stars. The system was first used by Johann Bayer in 1603.
    Brighter stars in a <a href="#constellation">constellation</a> usually have a letter
    near the beginning of the alphabet, and dimmer stars usually have a letter nearer
    the end of the alphabet. A few faint stars were given lower-case Roman letters from
    a to z or upper-case Roman letters from A to Q (p Eridani, N Velorum etc.) See also
    <a href="#flamsteed">Flamsteed number</a>.</dd>
<dt id="billion"><span class="orange">Billion</span></dt>
  <dd>1 billion = 1&nbsp;000&nbsp;000&nbsp;000.</dd>
<dt id="blackhole"><span class="orange">Black hole</span></dt>
  <dd>The ultimate cosmic plughole formed when a high mass <a href="#supergiant">supergiant 
    star</a> explodes in a <a href="#supernova">supernova</a> explosion at the 
    end of its life creating a super-dense point in space where nothing can escape 
    the gravitational pull. A star probably has to have a mass of more than 40 
    solar masses to create a black hole which typically have a mass of about 3 
    solar masses. Black holes can be detected by the disrupting effects they have 
    on neighbouring stars. The centres of most galaxies including our own are 
    believed to have super-massive black holes which have sucked in thousands 
    of stars.</dd>
<dt id="bluemag"><span class="orange">Blue Apparent Magnitude</span></dt>
  <dd>The <a href="#apparent">apparent magnitude</a> of a star or galaxy when viewed
    through a blue filter.  This magnitude system is commonly used for nearby galaxies
    because, historically, pictures of galaxies were photographed with photographic
    plates sensitive to blue light.</dd>
<dt id="bonner"><span class="orange">Bonner Durchmusterung catalogue</span> (BD, CD, CP)</dt>
  <dd>A star catalogue of 325&nbsp;037 northern stars produced between 1859 and 
    1862 with a supplement of 134&nbsp;833 southern stars produced in 1886. Later 
    came two more large southern star catalogues: the Cordoba Durchmusterung (613&nbsp;959 
    stars) produced between 1892 and 1932, and the Cape Photographic Durchmusterung 
    (454&nbsp;877 stars) produced between 1895 and 1900.</dd>
<dt id="bright"><span class="orange">Bright Star catalogue</span> (HR, BS, Yale)</dt>
  <dd>A star catalogue of nearly all the stars brighter than <a href="#magnitude">magnitude</a> 
    +6.5 published by the Yale University Observatory. The original version was 
    published in 1908 as the Harvard Revised Photometry Catalogue and it contains 
    9096 stars. The current version is the fifth edition.</dd>
<dt id="brown"><span class="orange">Brown dwarf star</span></dt>
  <dd>A failed star that was too small at its birth for nuclear reactions to occur 
    in its core. They may be very common, but because they only glow very dimly 
    they are very hard to detect. Brown dwarfs are <strong>not</strong> brown, they 
    begin their lives by glowing a dull red and then fade. Brown dwarfs are more 
    massive than planets, and range in mass from 10 to 80 times the mass of Jupiter 
    (or 0.01 to 0.08 times the mass of the Sun). There are two main types of brown 
    dwarfs - the hotter ones (1500K to 2500K) are type L; the cooler ones (below 
    1500K) are type T. The hottest brown dwarfs are sometimes classified as very 
    cool type M <a href="#red">red dwarf stars</a>.</dd>
<dt id="cluster"><span class="orange">Cluster of galaxies</span></dt>
  <dd>A concentration of <a href="#galaxy">galaxies</a> bound together by gravity. 
    The term 'cluster' usually refers to a large collection of many tens or hundreds 
    of <a href="#galaxy">galaxies</a> and the term 'group' is used for a much 
    smaller grouping.</dd>
<dt id="constellation"><span class="orange">Constellation</span> </dt>
  <dd>Random patterns of stars in the night sky produced by the chance alignment 
    of stars of different luminosities and distances. There are 88 constellations 
    - 48 were listed by the ancient Greeks, and another 40 were added after 1590.</dd>
<dt id="darkmatter"><span class="orange">Dark matter</span></dt>
  <dd>The visible stars and nebulae make up only a small fraction of all the matter 
    in the universe. The rest is in a form that is not easy to detect, but clearly 
    exists because of the effect it has on the motion of stars in <a href="#galaxy">galaxies</a> 
    and the motion of galaxies in <a href="#cluster">clusters</a>. Dark matter 
    probably consists of various types of subatomic particles.</dd>
<dt id="declination"><span class="orange">Declination</span> (Dec)</dt>
  <dd>See <a href="#equatorial">Equatorial coordinates</a>.</dd>
<dt id="dwarfgalaxy"><span class="orange">Dwarf galaxy</span></dt>
  <dd> A small <a href="#galaxy">galaxy</a> usually containing any number of stars 
    between a million and several billion. There is no official size below which 
    a <a href="#galaxy">galaxy</a> is designated a dwarf but any <a href="#galaxy">galaxy</a> 
    with a diameter below 30&nbsp;000 <a href="#light">light years</a> can be
    considered a dwarf.</dd>
<dt id="dwarfstar"><span class="orange">Dwarf star</span></dt>
  <dd>A normal <a href="#main">main sequence star</a> like the Sun that is burning 
    hydrogen in nuclear reactions in its core. The brightest dwarf stars can be 
    much larger than the Sun. See also <a href="#giant">Giant star</a>,
    <a href="#supergiant">Supergiant star</a>.</dd>
<dt id="elliptical"><span class="orange">Elliptical galaxy</span></dt>
  <dd>A <a href="#galaxy">galaxy</a> with a spherical or oval shape. They are 
    classified as type E and range in shape from type E0 - circular, to type E7 
    - very elliptical.</dd>
<dt id="equatorial"><span class="orange">Equatorial coordinates</span> (RA, Dec)</dt>
  <dd>The most common coordinate system used by astronomers. It is the equivalent 
    of the Earth's latitude and longitude projected onto the sky except that longitude 
    is called Right Ascension and latitude is called Declination. For historical 
    reasons, Right Ascension is not measured in degrees but in 'hours' - 24 hours 
    being equivalent to 360 degrees. Another complication is that this coordinate 
    system is very slowly moving with time - star positions for 1950 are slightly 
    different to those for the year 2000 for example.</dd>
<dt id="eso"><span class="orange">ESO catalogue</span> (ESO)</dt>
  <dd>The ESO/Uppsala Catalogue of Galaxies. An extension to the <a href="#ugc">UGC 
    catalogue</a> listing 18&nbsp;422 bright <a href="#galaxy">galaxies</a> south 
    of declination -20∞ published in 1982. Note that the combined UGC and ESO 
    catalogues do not cover the declination zone between -2.5∞ and -20∞.</dd>
<dt id="flamsteed"><span class="orange">Flamsteed number</span></dt>
  <dd>The combination of a number and the name of a <a href="#constellation">constellation</a> 
    (61 Cygni, 36 Ophiuchi etc.) used to identify naked-eye stars. The numbers 
    were applied to John Flamsteed's star catalogue published in 1725. Not all 
    naked-eye stars have a Flamsteed number and most stars in the far southern 
    hemisphere do not have one. See also <a href="#bayername">Bayer name</a>.</dd>
<dt id="galactic"><span class="orange">Galactic coordinates</span> (l, b)</dt>
  <dd>A coordinate system based on the plane of the <a href="#galaxy">Galaxy</a>, 
    it is centred on the Sun with the zero point of longitude and latitude pointing 
    directly at the galactic centre. The symbols used for galactic coordinates 
    are l (longitude) and b (latitude). The zero point of Galactic latitude and 
    longitude is at RA=17h45m37s Dec=-28∞56'10&quot;, and the Galactic north pole 
    is at RA=12h51m26s Dec=+27∞07'42&quot;, (epoch 2000 coordinates).</dd>
<dt id="galactocentric"><span class="orange">Galactocentric coordinates</span></dt>
  <dd>The same coordinate system as <a href="#galactic">galactic coordinates</a> 
    except that this system is centred on the centre of the <a href="#galaxy">Galaxy</a>. 
    The small uncertainty in the distance to the galactic centre prevents this 
    system from being widely used.</dd>
<dt id="galaxy"><span class="orange">Galaxy</span> </dt>
  <dd>A vast concentration of millions or billions of stars. There are four main 
    types of galaxies: <a href="#elliptical">Elliptical Galaxies</a>,
    <a href="#lenticular">Lenticular galaxies</a>, <a href="#spiral">Spiral Galaxies</a>
    and <a href="#irregular">Irregular galaxies</a>. Our galaxy contains 200 billion
    stars, but the largest galaxies contain many trillions. See also
    <a href="#dwarfgalaxy">Dwarf Galaxy</a>.</dd>
<dt id="giant"><span class="orange">Giant star</span></dt>
  <dd>A star the size of the Sun will end its life after several billion years 
    by expanding greatly because of changing energy balances at the core of the 
    star. The surface temperature drops and the star becomes redder, this lasts 
    several million years before the star throws off its outer layers and becomes 
    a <a href="#white">white dwarf</a>. See also <a href="#dwarfstar">Dwarf star</a>, 
    <a href="#supergiant">Supergiant star</a>.</dd>
<dt id="giclas"><span class="orange">Giclas catalogue</span> (G)</dt>
  <dd>The usual name given to the Lowell Proper Motion Survey catalogue produced 
    in the 1970's containing 11&nbsp;747 stars with a high <a href="#proper">proper 
    motion</a>.</dd>
<dt id="gliese"><span class="orange">Gliese catalogue</span> (Gl, Wo, GJ)</dt>
  <dd>The usual name given to three catalogues of nearby stars compiled by W Gliese 
    (and later by H Jahreiﬂ) in 1957, 1969 and 1993. The third catalogue which 
    listed 3803 stars within 25 <a href="#parsec">parsecs</a> was only released 
    in a preliminary form.</dd>
<dt id="globular"><span class="orange">Globular star cluster</span></dt>
  <dd>A spherical cluster of many thousands of stars. Globular clusters usually 
    have a size of 50 to 150 <a href="#light">light years</a> and are found scattered 
    in a spherical halo surrounding <a href="#galaxy">galaxies</a>.</dd>
<dt id="group"><span class="orange">Group of galaxies</span></dt>
  <dd>A concentration of <a href="#galaxy">galaxies</a> bound together by gravity. 
    The term 'group' usually refers to a small collection of a few tens of
    <a href="#galaxy">galaxies</a> and the term 'cluster' is used for a much larger
    grouping.</dd>

    <a href="#light">light years</a>.</dd>
<dt id="hubble"><span class="orange">Hubble constant</span> (H)</dt>
  <dd>The value which describes the rate at which the universe is currently expanding. 
    The Hubble constant helps to determine the size and age of the universe, and 
    is also used to convert the <a href="#redshift">redshift</a> of a
    <a href="#galaxy">galaxy</a> into a distance estimate.  The Hubble constant is not
    known precisely but it is somewhere in the range of 60 to 80 km/s/Mpc.</dd>

  <dd>The Index Catalogue.  A supplement to the <a href="#ngc">NGC catalogue</a> 
    listing an extra 5386 <a href="#starclust">star clusters</a>,
    <a href="#nebula">nebulae</a> and <a href="#galaxy">galaxies</a>.  It is actually
    a combination of two catalogues, the first published in 1895 and the second in
    1908. See also <a href="#ngc">NGC catalogue</a>.</dd>
<dt id="irregular"><span class="orange">Irregular galaxy</span></dt>
  <dd>A <a href="#galaxy">galaxy</a> with a very irregular shape and no obvious

  <dd>See <a href="#arcminute">Arcminute</a>.</dd>
<dt id="nebula"><span class="orange">Nebula</span> </dt>
  <dd>A cloud of interstellar gas and dust. Bright nebulae glow with light emitted 
    by the gas of which they are composed (emission nebulae) or by reflected starlight 
    (reflection nebulae) or both. Dark nebulae consist of clouds of gas and dust 
    that are not illuminated. <a href="#planetary">Planetary nebulae</a> are shells 
    of gas ejected by stars.</dd>
<dt id="neutron"><span class="orange">Neutron star</span></dt>
  <dd>The core of a <a href="#supergiant">supergiant star</a> which has collapsed 
    during a <a href="#supernova">supernova</a> explosion so much that it consists 
    entirely of neutrons. Most stars between 8 and 60 solar masses end their lives 
    like this usually producing a neutron star with a mass of about 1.4 solar 
    masses. Neutron stars are only 10 kilometres across and have an incredible 
    density - a teaspoon of neutron star material would have a mass of hundreds 
    of millions of tonnes. See also <a href="#blackhole">Black hole</a>.</dd>

<dt id="open"><span class="orange">Open star cluster</span> </dt>
  <dd>A cluster of stars usually containing several hundred members packed into

  <dd>The tiny periodic shift of the apparent positions of nearby stars due to 
    the changing position of the Earth as it orbits the Sun. The nearer the star 
    is, the larger the shift. The distance to stars in <a href="#parsec">parsecs</a>

    have continued to receive PGC numbers so that there are now over 1 million
    galaxies with PGC numbers.</dd>
<dt id="planetary"><span class="orange">Planetary nebula</span></dt>
  <dd>An expanding envelope of gas surrounding a hot <a href="#white">white 
    dwarf</a>. It is formed at the end of a <a href="#giant">giant star's</a> 
    life when the core contracts ejecting the outer atmosphere of the star creating 
    both the <a href="#white">white dwarf</a> and the <a href="#nebula">nebula</a>.
    The intense radiation from the central <a href="#white">white dwarf</a> 
    makes the <a href="#nebula">nebula</a> glow. Planetary nebulae disperse

    astronomers they looked a bit like planets.</dd>
<dt id="proper"><span class="orange">Proper Motion</span></dt>
  <dd>The slow steady shift of the apparent positions of nearby stars over many 
    years because of their independent motion within the <a href="#galaxy">Galaxy</a>.

    velocity generally lies further from the observer than one with a smaller
    radial velocity.</dd>
<dt id="red"><span class="orange">Red dwarf star</span></dt>
  <dd>The smallest and dimmest stars. About 80% of all stars are red dwarfs although 
    none are visible from Earth with the naked eye. Because they shine with less

  <dd>An increase in the wavelength of light caused either by the source of the
    light moving away from the observer or by the expansion of the universe.
    In an expanding universe <a href="#galaxy">galaxies</a> with large redshifts
    lie at greater distances than <a href="#galaxy">galaxies</a> with small
    redshifts. Redshifts can also be produce by light climbing out of a strong
    gravitational field such as a <a href="#blackhole">black hole</a>.</dd>
<dt id="rich"><span class="orange">Rich cluster of galaxies</span></dt>
  <dd>A <a href="#cluster">cluster of galaxies</a> containing hundreds of large

<dt id="spectral"><span class="orange">Spectral Classification</span></dt>
  <dd>The system used to classify stars. Stars fall into seven main catagories: 
    O, B, A, F, G, K and M ranging from hot blue-white stars to cooler red stars. 
    A number (0 to 9) is usually added to denote a sub-class. A roman numeral 
    is sometimes added to denote the size of the star. <a href="#supergiant">Supergiant 
    stars</a> are class I, <a href="#giant">Giant stars</a> are class III, and
    ordinary <a href="#main">main sequence</a> stars are class V. (Types II and IV
    are inbetween types).  The Sun is type G2V, whereas Arcturus - an orange
    <a href="#giant">giant star</a> - is type K2III.</dd>
<dt id="spiral"><span class="orange">Spiral galaxy</span></dt>
  <dd>A <a href="#galaxy">galaxy</a> with spiral arms. 
    There are two main types, those with central bar - SB, and those without - 
    S (or SA). Spiral galaxies are also subdivided into types a, b, c (and sometimes 
    d), depending on how tightly wound the spiral arms are.</dd>

    of galaxies</a>. Superclusters range in size from 100 million to 500 
    million <a href="#light">light years</a> and are usually embedded in
    large sheets and walls of <a href="#galaxy">galaxies</a> surrounding large
    voids in which very few <a href="#galaxy">galaxies</a> exist. Superclusters
    formed in the early universe when matter clumped together under the
    influence of gravity.</dd>
<dt id="supergalax"><span class="orange">Supergalactic coordinates</span> (L, B)</dt>
  <dd>A coordinate system based on the approximate plane of the Virgo
    <a href="#superclust">Supercluster</a>.  The supergalactic plane passes through the Sun
    and the middle of the Virgo cluster. Several nearby <a href="#superclust">superclusters</a> 
    also lie close to this plane. The symbols used for supergalactic coordinates 
    are L (longitude) and B (latitude). The zero point of Supergalactic latitude 
    and longitude is at RA=02h49m14s Dec=+59∞31'42&quot;, and the Supergalactic 
    north pole is at RA=18h55m01s Dec=+15∞42'32&quot;, (epoch 2000 coordinates).</dd>
<dt id="supergiant"><span class="orange">Supergiant star</span></dt>
  <dd>A star bigger than about 10 solar masses will become a supergiant star at 
    the end of its life as hydrogen burning ceases causing the stars outer layers 
    to expand. Supergiant stars are the largest and brightest of all stars and 
    they usually end up exploding in a <a href="#supernova">supernova</a> 
    explosion and creating a <a href="#neutron">neutron star</a> or a
    <a href="#blackhole">black hole</a>. See also <a href="#dwarfstar">Dwarf star</a>,
    <a href="#giant">Giant star</a>.</dd>
<dt id="supernova"><span class="orange">Supernova</span> </dt>
  <dd>A catastrophic stellar explosion that can briefly outshine an entire
    <a href="#galaxy">galaxy</a> of billions of stars. It can occur when a
    <a href="#supergiant">supergiant star</a> exhausts all its nuclear fuel
    causing the core of the star to collapse releasing a vast amount of
    energy which blasts away the outer parts of the star and leaves behind
    a <a href="#neutron">neutron star</a> or in extreme cases a 
    <a href="#blackhole">black hole</a>.</dd>
<dt id="supernovarem"><span class="orange">Supernova remnant</span></dt>

<dt id="temp"><span class="orange">Temperature</span> </dt>
  <dd>In astronomy, temperature is measured with the Kelvin scale (symbol K) which 
    is equal to ∞C + 273∞. Thus a midday Earth temperature of 20∞C is equal to 
    293K and the Sun's surface temperature of 5500∞C is about 5770K.</dd>

    See also <a href="#eso">ESO Catalogue</a>.</dd>
<dt id="variable"><span class="orange">Variable star</span></dt>
  <dd>A star that varies in brightness. There are many types, some stars can change 
    in brightness in a matter of minutes whereas others change slowly over many 
    months. The first 334 variable stars discovered in a constellation are given 
    a one or two letter code such as R Scuti or UV Ceti. Other variable stars 
    are designated V335, V336, etc. Proxima Centauri for example is known to variable 
    star astronomers as V645 Centauri.</dd>
<dt id="visual"><span class="orange">Visual magnitude</span></dt>
  <dd>Another name for <a href="#apparent">Apparent magnitude</a>.</dd>
<dt id="white"><span class="orange">White dwarf star</span></dt>
  <dd>The dying remnant of a <a href="#giant">giant star</a> 
    that has blown away its outer layers to reveal an intensely hot core. Only 
    the youngest white dwarfs are actually white, over billions of years they 
    slowly cool and change colour to yellow or orange (although the coolest white 
    dwarfs are bluer than expected because the compressed atmosphere of hydrogen 
    filters out the red light). They eventually become a dead black dwarf, although 
    because the universe is less than 15 billion years old none have yet cooled 
    this much. They are classified as type D stars.</dd>
