<h1>M16 and M17 - The Eagle and Omega Nebulae</h1>
<p>Ten degrees north of the Lagoon and Trifid nebulae lie another pair of famous
nebulae.  Known as the Eagle nebula (top) and Omega nebula (bottom), this picture
shows these two nebulae against the background of the dense star fields of the
Sagittarius Arm of the Galaxy.  The numerous dark patches in this picture show that
the Eagle and Omega nebulae are only the brightest areas in a region which also
contains many dark nebulae.

<h3>The Nebulae associated with the Eagle and Omega Nebulae</h3>
<p>This is a list of the nebulae in this region.  The Eagle nebula (M16) is the
largest of the two nebulae, although the name M16 (or NGC 6611) is often used only
for the bright central region of the nebula and IC 4703 is used for the entire
nebula.  The Omega nebula (M17) is the other bright nebula here and it also 
includes IC 4706 and IC 4707.  IC 4701 is also a fairly large (but much fainter)
emission nebula in this region.

<h3>Star clusters associated with the Eagle and Omega Nebulae</h3>
<p>These are the star clusters which are perhaps most closely associated with the
Eagle and Omega nebulae.  Both nebulae contain star clusters at their centres
(NGC 6611 and NGC 6618) which are responsible for causing the gas to glow.

<h2>A Map of the Eagle and Omega Nebulae</h2>
<p>This is a map of these two nebulae.  The Eagle and Omega nebulae are two bright
patches among many clouds of gas and dust which can be found all along the Sagittarius
Arm.</p>

<h2>The Omega Nebula</h2>
<p>This is a picture of the Omega nebula - the nearest of the two nebulae.  The
Omega nebula is known to be situated at the northeast end of a huge (and dark)
molecular cloud that stretches across several hundred light years.  The stars
in the cluster in the centre of the Omega nebula are very young with an average
age of about 1 million years.

<td>The Eagle and Omega nebulae are both in the Sagittarius Arm of the Galaxy.  The
Eagle nebula (M16) is the most distant of the two nebulae - it is about 5700 light
years from us.  The Omega nebula (M17) is about 4250 light years away and it is
probably closer to the Lagoon nebula than to Eagle nebula.

<h2>The Hubble Space Telescope picture of the Eagle Nebula</h2>
<p>
In April 1995, the Hubble Space Telescope took this picture of the centre of the
Eagle nebula.  It is one of the most famous pictures made by the Hubble Space
Telescope.  It revealed huge columns of hydrogen with a length of several light
years.  Many stars are forming inside these huge columns which are being blasted
by intense radiation from many of the nearby stars.  This picture was so stunning
that it soon appeared everywhere.  Publishers of astronomy books use this image
a lot - they love to print it in books, posters and calendars even though there
are many other superb Hubble Space Telescope pictures available.

<p>Few people realise however, that the colours in this image are not realistic.
Hubble Space Telescope pictures of nebulae rarely use realistic colours.  The colours
are usually chosen to maximise the scientific value of the image.  Below I have
reconstructed this Eagle nebula picture using a realistic colour balance.  This is
much closer to what you would actually see if you could stand a few light years from
the centre of Eagle nebula.    Notice, for example, that the stars in this image are
not pink but blue-white.
