<h1>A Map of the Milky Way</h1>
<p>This is a drawing of the Milky Way looking down from above.  The evidence
for this picture is provided below.  The Sun is just one of 200 billion stars
in this typical barred-spiral galaxy that is about 90&nbsp;000 light years in diameter.

<p>A larger and unlabelled version of the above map is available <a href="milkyway2.jpg" tppabs="http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/milkyway2.jpg">here</a>.
</p>
<p>I have used the most common names for the spiral arms on this map.  But
occasionally you may find alternative names being used for the spiral arms.
This table lists some of the alternative names:
</p>
<div class="center">
<table class="databox">
  <tr><th>Common Name     </th><th>Alternative Name       </th></tr>
  <tr><td>Norma Arm       </td><td>3 kiloparsec Arm       </td></tr>
  <tr><td>Scutum-Crux Arm </td><td>Centaurus Arm          </td></tr>
  <tr><td>Sagittarius Arm </td><td>Sagittarius-Carina Arm </td></tr>
  <tr><td>Orion Arm       </td><td>Local Arm              </td></tr>
  <tr><td>Perseus Arm     </td><td> -                     </td></tr>
  <tr><td>Cygnus Arm      </td><td>Outer Arm              </td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>Note also that the Orion Arm is not a major spiral arm, but only an enhancement
of stars and gas between the Sagittarius and Perseus arms.
</p>
<p>It should be emphasized that there are almost as many stars between the spiral
arms as in the spiral arms.  The reason why the arms of spiral galaxies are so 
prominant is that the brightest stars are found in the spiral arms.  Spiral arms 
are the major regions of star formation in spiral galaxies and this is where most 
of the major nebulae are found.

<h2>The Shape of the Milky Way - The Evidence</h2>

<p>
There are two methods traditionally used to map the spiral structure of our Galaxy.  
The first method is to study the density of the neutral hydrogen (HI) in the plane 
of the Galaxy which is enhanced in the spiral arms.  This was first attempted by 
Jan Oort, Frank Kerr, and Gart Westerhout in 1958.  They studied

early version</a> of their map (incomplete on the left side) shows various sections
of the spiral arms.  The second method is to plot the giant
HII regions (bright nebulae of ionised hydrogen) which are usually formed in the spiral
arms.  This was attempted by Yvonne and Yvon Georgelin in 1976.  They studied

If we put all this data together then we get a map like this one below.  There 
is not much data available about the far side of the Galaxy but spiral
galaxies are usually fairly symmetrical.  Features on one side of a galaxy are
often repeated on the other side.

<h2>Properties of the Milky Way</h2>
<p>This is a list of some of the main parameters of the Milky Way.  Most of these
numbers are approximate.  Galaxies do not have precise boundaries - the stars slowly
become less plentiful as you move away from the galaxy.

Below - four galaxies which look like the Milky Way.  NGC 3953 (top left) is
55 million light years away and 95000 light years in diameter.  NGC 5970 (top right)
is 105 million light years away and 85000 light years in diameter.  NGC 7329
(bottom left) is even further at a distance of 140 million light years but it is 
larger with a diameter of 140000 light years.  NGC 7723 (bottom right) is 80 
million light years away with a diameter of 90000 light years.
