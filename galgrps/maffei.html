<h1>The Maffei Group</h1>
<p>The Maffei group is a famous nearby group of galaxies even though most of
the galaxies in the group have only been discovered in the past twenty years.  A
lot of the galaxies in this group lie directly behind the plane of our galaxy and
are hidden by all the intervening gas, dust and stars.  Only the left side of this
group around the nearby IC 342 galaxy is easily visible - most of the galaxies
around Maffei I and II were not discovered until the 1990's.

<p>Below - three very obscured galaxies.  Maffei I (left) is the nearest
large elliptical galaxy.  Maffei II (centre) is a spiral galaxy with a
prominant bar at the centre of it.  Dwingeloo 1 (right) is a barred spiral
galaxy at the back of the group but it is so faint that it was not discovered
until 1994.  The foreground dust in our galaxy blocks most of the blue light
from these galaxies and makes them look much more red than they actually are.

<h2>The Galaxies of the Maffei Group</h2>
<p>This is a list of the main galaxies in the Maffei group.  A lot of the
diameters of these galaxies are only rough estimates because most of these
galaxies are very obscured.  The dominant galaxies in this group are
IC 342, Maffei I and Maffei II.

announcement</a> of a third major galaxy was made by Kraan-Korteweg, Loan,
Burton, Lahav, Ferguson, Henning and Lynden-Bell in 1994.  The galaxy was
discovered using the Dwingeloo 25m radio telescope in the Netherlands and so
was named Dwingeloo 1.  A small companion galaxy - Dwingeloo 2 - was discovered
shortly afterwards.

<p>Shown below are three other galaxies in this group.  NGC 1560 (left) is
a spiral or irregular galaxy viewed edge-on.  NGC 1569 (centre) is only
a dwarf galaxy but it is probably the nearest example of a <em>starburst</em> galaxy -
a galaxy which is rapidly forming a lot of new stars.  UGCA 105 (right) is
a dwarf galaxy with vague signs of spiral structure.

<p>Below is a picture of IC 342.  This is probably the largest galaxy in the
Maffei group.  If it was not so close to the plane of the Milky Way, it
would probably be one of the most famous galaxies in the sky.  (It would
possibly be a naked-eye object).  This galaxy was not discovered until
about 1890 because it is rather obscured by the foreground dust and stars in
our own galaxy, but it is still a spectacular galaxy.
