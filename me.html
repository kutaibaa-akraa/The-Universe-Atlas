<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Richard Powell, I live in Great Britain, so any strange
spellings you Americans see on my web page is just British English, honest. :-)
</p>
<p>I have two degrees in astrophysics - a Bachelor's degree from the

a Master's degree from the <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.ph.rhul.ac.uk/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.ph.rhul.ac.uk/'" tppabs="http://www.ph.rhul.ac.uk/">University of London</a>.
For my MSc research I studied the Big Bang, trying to understand what the
universe was like when it was less than one second old.
I made this web page because I wanted to see for myself what the universe
looked like, and I thought maybe some other people out there might also be
interested.
</p>
<p>I welcome emails, my email address is:
<span class="yellow"><i>s&#105;nginglemon&#64;e&#97;rthling.net</i></span>
</p>
<p>My apologies for being uncommunicative recently. I promise to reply to all emails - really! :-)

<p>Right, that's all you're getting for now, but hey, here's one final statistic:
</p>
<p>Only 0.000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 1% of the observable
universe lies within our solar system.  So lets start building starships - it's
a big universe out there. :-)

<h2>IC443 - A Nearby Supernova Remnant</h2>
<p>
Thirty thousand years ago, a massive star in the Perseus Arm of our galaxy exploded.
For a few weeks the explosion would have shone with the light of a billion suns.  Our 
ancestors would have seen this supernova explosion as a bright point of light that would 
have been visible in daylight.  This picture shows what is left of this star today.  
The remains of the star are now an expanding bubble of debris sixty light years in 
diameter.  Eventually much of this material may end up in new stars and planets.
