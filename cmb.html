<h1>The Cosmic Microwave Background</h1>
<p>If we look far enough across the universe, we can detect the light that has
been travelling since the beginning of the universe nearly 14 billion years ago.
This allows us to see the faint glow of the Big Bang all around us.  Although
this radiation can not be seen with the human eye, it can easily be detected
with radio telescopes.  This <a href="galchart.html" tppabs="http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galchart.html">all-sky map</a> was produced
with data from the <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/m_mm.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/m_mm.html'" tppabs="http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/m_mm.html">WMAP cosmology probe</a>;
it shows the glow of the Big Bang when the universe was only 380&nbsp;000 years old
and the universe had a temperature of 3000°C.
</p>
<p>This is the one of the major reasons why astronomers know that the
universe was formed 14 billion years ago in a hot, dense, event known as the
<em>Big Bang</em> - because we are surrounded by the faint glow of the Big Bang,
and it looks like this:

<p>The temperature variations in this map explain why the galaxies in the
universe cluster together into superclusters.  The matter in the Big Bang was
clumpy.  These clumps correspond to the coolest (darkest) spots on this map,
and it was in these clumps that galaxies were most likely to form.  The hottest
(brightest) spots were low-density regions which eventually, after billions of
years, became huge voids.
