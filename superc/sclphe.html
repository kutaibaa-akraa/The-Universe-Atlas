<h1>The Sculptor Superclusters</h1>
<p>The superclusters in the Sculptor region of the sky are not obvious
structures.  This map is a plot of the brightest galaxies (from the Principal 
Galaxies Catalogue) in this region of the sky and although the locations
of the main clusters are marked, the superclusters are hard to see.  The 
Sculptor superclusters are important however because they are contained within
a major wall of galaxies which sweeps through this region of the sky across 
nearly a billion light years of space.

<p>Below is a list of the clusters in the two Sculptor superclusters.  The
nearest of the two superclusters is mainly within the constellation of
Phoenix and so is perhaps best called the Phoenix supercluster.  Note that
the six clusters in this Phoenix supercluster are all of richness class
zero.  This means that none of them are impressive clusters.  The second
supercluster (which is mainly in Sculptor) does contain richer clusters
but they are also much further away and harder to see.

<h2>The Sculptor Wall</h2>
<p>The map below is a <em>slice of the universe</em> which shows the Sculptor Wall.  This map
is a plot of 7400 bright galaxies (from the <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www-obs.univ-lyon1.fr/hypercat/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www-obs.univ-lyon1.fr/hypercat/'" tppabs="http://www-obs.univ-lyon1.fr/hypercat/">HyperLeda</a>
database) in the vicinity of the Sculptor Wall.  Our galaxy is at the bottom and the
top of the map is 800 million light years away.  The red line shows the Sculptor Wall
which is sometimes called the <em>Southern Wall</em>.  The wall is faint beyond 500 million 
light years because the data is incomplete beyond that distance.  Notice that the 
nearest part of the wall (the Phoenix supercluster) lies next to a large rectangular
void.  This is called the Sculptor Void, and it is one of the largest voids in the 
nearby universe.

<p>Below is a picture of the A2877 cluster, it is probably the most impressive of
the clusters in these two superclusters because it is dominated by the giant
elliptical galaxy IC 1633.  This galaxy has a diameter greater than 270&nbsp;000
light years and it rivals the two huge galaxies in the <a href="com.html" tppabs="http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/superc/com.html">Coma cluster</a>
in terms of size and luminosity.
