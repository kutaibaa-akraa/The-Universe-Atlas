<h1>The Hercules Superclusters</h1>
<p>The superclusters in Hercules are famous superclusters.  This plot of galaxies
(from the Principal Galaxies Catalogue) shows the two superclusters.The northern
supercluster at a distance of 400 million light years is dominated by the 
A2197/A2199 pair of clusters.  Slightly further away at a distance of 500 million
light years is the larger southern supercluster dominated by the clusters A2147, 
A2151 and A2152.  Both superclusters are connected to each other and are sometimes
referred to as a single supercluster.

<p>Below is a list of the major clusters of galaxies in the Hercules Superclusters.
The richest cluster is the A2151 cluster which is sometimes called the Hercules
cluster.  A2199 which is the nearest of all these clusters is also very rich as
well.  Two of these clusters - A1983 and A2040 - are at the back of the supercluster
but may also be member clusters as well.

<h2>A2151 - The Hercules Cluster</h2>
<p>The Hercules cluster, A2151, is the richest cluster in the Hercules
supercluster.  Photographs of this cluster often appear in books because it 
contains some large spiral galaxies as well as the elliptical and lenticular
galaxies usually found in rich clusters.  There are no giant elliptical 
galaxies which are often found at the centre of very rich clusters.

<p>This is a map of the Hercules cluster.  This map shows 115 of the
brightest galaxies in the central one degree area of the cluster.  This is
an interesting cluster because it contains a wide variety of different galaxy
types.  It is quite likely that this cluster consists of several smaller
clusters that are merging together.</p>

<h2>The Scientific Study of the Hercules Superclusters</h2>
<p>The first person who was aware of the superclusters in Hercules was
probably Harlow Shapley in the 1930's.  He noticed the cluster pair A2197/A2199
and the three clusters A2147, A2151 and A2152.  For example, in

It was not until the 1970's that other astronomers also realised that there were
superclusters here.  Massimo Tarenghi in 1976, while studying the A2151 cluster,

suggested</a> that it was part of a supercluster.  At a conference about the
Large Scale Structure of the Universe in Estonia in 1977, he presented
