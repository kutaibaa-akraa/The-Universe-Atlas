<h1>The Corona Borealis Supercluster</h1>
<p>Although it is one billion light years from us, the Corona Borealis supercluster
is famous because it is a fairly obvious concentration of clusters of galaxies.

<p>Below is a list of the Corona Borealis Supercluster clusters.  A2065 is the
most famous of these clusters although a lot of the other clusters here are also
quite rich.  Two of these clusters, A2122 and A2124, are actually the same 
cluster.  A2124 is the center of the cluster and A2122 is an extension of it.

<h2>A2065 - The Corona Borealis Cluster</h2>
<p>Below is a picture of the centre of the A2065 cluster.  This cluster is often
called the Corona Borealis cluster.  It is the richest cluster of galaxies in
the Corona Borealis supercluster.  This cluster is famous mainly because it was
one of several clusters used by Milton Humason and Edwin Hubble in the 1930's to
demonstrate that the universe is expanding.

This is a map of the A2065 cluster.  This map shows 119 of the brightest 
galaxies in this cluster.  A lot of the galaxies in this cluster have not been 
accurately classified, so some of the classifications used in this map are 
probably wrong, although it is clearly a cluster which contains a wide variety
of different galaxy types.</p>

They noticed the presence of another supercluster behind the Corona Borealis
supercluster (associated with A2034, A2049, A2062, A2069 and A2083) at a distance
of 1.5 billion light years (redshift 0.113).  They also believe that the clusters
at the centre of the Corona Borealis supercluster are collapsing together and will
eventually form one big cluster.

<p>F Kopylova and A Kopylov agree with them.  They

The Corona Borealis cluster (A2065) was discovered by Edwin Hubble in the 1930's.
