<h1>The Perseus-Pisces Supercluster</h1>
<p>The Perseus-Pisces supercluster is the most obvious supercluster in the sky.
Although, like all superclusters, it is much too faint to be seen with the naked
eye, this plot of bright galaxies in this region of the sky (from the Principal
Galaxies Catalogue) shows how prominant it is.  The Perseus-Pisces supercluster is 
a long, dense wall of galaxies with a length of almost 300 million light years.  At
the left end of the supercluster lies the massive <em>Perseus cluster</em> (A426),
one of the most massive clusters of galaxies within 500 million light years.

<p>Below are the major clusters in the Perseus-Pisces supercluster as listed in the
Abell catalogue.  A426 is the most important of these clusters and was given a
<em>richness class</em> of 2, which means it is a very rich cluster of galaxies.
A262 is also a fairly rich cluster although it only received a <em>richness class</em>
of 0.

<p>Below are some of the other major groups of galaxies in the Perseus-Pisces
supercluster.  Several of these groups are quite big, especially the NGC 383 
group and the NGC 507 group which are both known as the <em>Pisces cluster</em>.  There
are also some groups of galaxies around the <em>Pegasus cluster</em> which is part of a
much smaller supercluster slightly detached from the Perseus-Pisces supercluster.

<h3>The Taurus Void</h3>

<br />
<p>Not only is the Perseus-Pisces supercluster the most obvious supercluster in the
sky but it also lies next to the most obvious void in the sky.  The Taurus void
is a large circular void bounded by walls of galaxies on either side of it.  The
void has a diameter of about 100 million light years.  Most of the galaxies plotted
in the area of the void are background galaxies that lie behind the void.
</p>
<p>Below: There are a few galaxies within the void.  This is a picture of UGC2627 
(at RA=03h17m, Dec=31°34') and its smaller companion galaxy UGC2629.  These two 
galaxies are 185 million light years away in the northern half of the void.

<h2>A426 - The Perseus Cluster</h2>
<p>The Perseus cluster is the second nearest of the really rich clusters of galaxies
which contain thousands of galaxies.  The nearest - A3627 - is almost hidden by the
plane of our galaxy and is not easy to observe.  This picture below shows the central
part of the Perseus cluster.  The two brightest galaxies at the centre of this cluster
are NGC1272 (right) and NGC1275 (left).  The Perseus cluster is also fairly close to 
the plane of the Milky Way, so a lot of the faintest points of light in this image are 
actually foreground stars in our own galaxy.
