<h1>The Coma Supercluster</h1>
<p>The Coma supercluster is a very famous supercluster.  This map below is a plot of
the brightest galaxies (from the Principal Galaxies Catalogue) in this region of the sky.
Dominating this picture is the <a href="../galgrps/vir.html" tppabs="http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galgrps/vir.html">Virgo cluster</a> - the nearest
rich cluster in the universe and the dominant cluster in the the Virgo supercluster.  Above
the Virgo cluster and much further away are two much richer clusters - A1367 and A1656.
These are the two main clusters in the Coma supercluster.

<p>Below is a list of the major clusters in the Coma Supercluster.  The supercluster
contains only two major clusters of galaxies.  They are both very rich clusters with
a <em>richness class</em> of 2, although A1656 is larger and richer than A1367.

<h2>A1656 - The Coma Cluster</h2>
<p>The Coma cluster (A1656) is one of the most famous clusters of galaxies.  It has
received a huge amount of scientific research.  This is partly because it is a
very rich cluster containing thousands of galaxies.  Another reason is that
the Coma cluster lies a long way from the plane of our Galaxy (unlike the Perseus
cluster, or the A3627 cluster) and it is largely unobscured by any gas and dust or
any foreground stars.
</p>
<p>The Coma cluster is dominated by two enormous elliptical galaxies.  These are
NGC4874 (right) and NGC4889 (left), they both have a diameter larger than 250&nbsp;000
light years and they are much more massive than any galaxies in the Virgo supercluster.
There is also one obvious foreground star in this image, HD112887, an eighth 
magnitude star 265 light years away - less than one millionth of the distance to
the Coma cluster.

<br />
<p>This is a map of the central area of the Coma cluster.  This map shows the
positions of 118 of the brightest galaxies in the core of this cluster.  It is
immediately obvious that there are very few spiral galaxies, and no bright irregular 
galaxies.  Nearly all of the galaxies here are elliptical and lenticular galaxies.  
One of the most popular theories on how elliptical and lenticular galaxies form is 
that they form from the merger of smaller galaxies.  In the dense enviroment of the
Coma cluster there have probably been many galaxy mergers over billions of years, 
and the result is a cluster with a very low number of spiral and irregular 
galaxies.</p>

<br />
<p>This is a second map of the Coma cluster.  This map has a width of four
degrees (the previous map had a width of two-thirds of a degree).  The blue
points show the spiral galaxies and irregular galaxies, they are clearly more
numerous in the outer parts of the cluster.  This is very common in very rich
clusters - the elliptical/lenticular galaxies are usually found in the centre,
and the spiral/irregular galaxies are usually found in the outer regions.</p>

The Coma supercluster has played a very important role in our knowledge of the

that the universe was filled with superclusters and voids (see the page on the

a famous map</a> of the Coma supercluster.  This picture was published in
newspapers and magazines around the world because it showed the Coma cluster
(looking like a strange stick-man figure) at the centre of a <em>Great Wall</em> of
galaxies with a length of about six hundred million light years.  It confirmed
that the galaxies in the universe are arranged in sheets and walls surrounding
large nearly-empty voids.

surveying this region of the sky.  John Huchra has written

<p>
The Coma cluster (A1656) has also played a very important role in our understanding
of the universe.  William Herschel discovered this cluster in 1785.  In 1933,
Fritz Zwicky submitted a paper to a Swiss Journal (Helvetica Physica Acta 6, 110)
with the title: <em>Die Rotverschiebung von extragalaktischen Nebeln</em>, (<em>The redshift
of extragalactic nebulae</em>).  By studying the velocities of the galaxies in the
cluster he showed that the cluster contained much more dark, invisible matter than
visible matter.  He later summarised his results in
  <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept01/Zwicky/frames.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept01/Zwicky/frames.html'" tppabs="http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept01/Zwicky/frames.html">
a paper</a> (mainly in section 3) published in the Astrophysical Journal in 1937.
Although he was correct, his research was ignored by other astronomers until the
1970's when astronomers began to realise that most of the matter in the universe
must be of a dark, unseen type.  The precise nature of this <em>dark matter</em> is still
a mystery but it probably consists of enormous amounts of tiny subatomic particles
which are present throughout the entire universe.
</p>
<p>
A huge amount of scientific research is directed at the Coma cluster.  Only the
Virgo cluster has received a similar amount of attention.  In the five years from
1997 to 2001 approximately 125 papers were published about the Coma cluster, (almost
identical to the number published about the Virgo cluster in the same period).
</p>
<p>
The Leo cluster (A1367) is also a very rich cluster, but because it is not as rich
as the Coma cluster it is not studied as much.  (Between 1997 and 2001 approximately
11 papers were written about this cluster).
</p>

<hr />
<h2>A1367 - The Leo Cluster</h2>
<p>Below is a picture of part of the Leo cluster.  It is not as famous as the Coma 
cluster because it is slightly smaller and it contains fewer galaxies.  The bright 
elliptical galaxy in the centre is NGC 3842 and the large spiral galaxy on the left 
is NGC 3861.
