in front of the Shapley supercluster.  Behind the Centaurus supercluster at a
distance of 500 million light years is another small supercluster (with <span class="lgreen">green</span>

of major galaxy clusters (marked with <span class="lcyan">blue</span> labels) - this is the Shapley

<p>This is a list of the major clusters of galaxies in the Shapley Supercluster.
There are 25 clusters of galaxies in this list (which does not include the four
clusters in the <a href="cen.html" tppabs="http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/superc/cen.html">Centaurus supercluster</a>).  Seven of these 
clusters have a <em>richness class</em> of 2 or higher, which means (roughly) that
there are seven clusters here which are as rich as the Perseus or Coma clusters.

<p>This map (which looks down onto the supergalactic plane) shows all of the
major clusters of galaxies between us and the Shapley supercluster.  Our Galaxy 
is located at the lower-left, and between us and the Shapley supercluster lies 
the Centaurus supercluster.  At a distance of 650 million light years, the 
Shapley supercluster is a dense collection of approximately 20 major clusters of 
galaxies contained within a region that is not much larger than the Virgo 
supercluster (which only contains one major cluster).  
</p>
<p>In the middle of the Shapley supercluster are several massive clusters.  The 
Abell catalogue contains only five clusters of galaxies with a <em>richness class</em> 
above 2 within one billion light years from us.  Three of these clusters (A3558, 
A3559 and A3560) are in the Shapley supercluster.  The fourth cluster (A3128) is 
in the <a href="hor.html" tppabs="http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/superc/hor.html">Horologium supercluster</a>, and the fifth cluster (A3301)
is on the edge of the Horologium supercluster.
These clusters are some of the richest clusters of galaxies known and some of them
contain more galaxies than the very rich <a href="com.html" tppabs="http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/superc/com.html">Coma cluster</a>.

<h2>A3558 - The Shapley 8 Cluster</h2>
<p>This is a picture of the centre of the A3558 cluster.  The various blue
objects in this image are the galaxies (except for the very obvious blue star at
the lower-left) and the yellow objects are foreground stars.  This cluster is
sometimes called <em>Shapley 8</em> because it was the eighth cluster in a list of rich
clusters which Harlow Shapley published in 1933.  At the centre of the cluster
is an enormous elliptical galaxy (ESO444-46) with a diameter larger than 340 
thousand light years.

<p>Below is a map of the A3558 cluster.  This map shows 135 of the brightest galaxies
in this cluster.  The galaxies here are spread across a distance of about 10 million
light years which is roughly the diameter of our <a href="../localgr.html" tppabs="http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/localgr.html">Local Group</a>.  
It is likely that there are some other smaller groups of galaxies in the foreground
and background of this cluster which make the cluster look slightly richer than it 
actually is.

<h3>Harlow Shapley (1885 - 1972)</h3>

<br />
<p>Harlow Shapley was born on November 2, 1885, in Missouri, USA.  After attending
the University of Missouri and Princeton University, he joined the staff of the
Mount Wilson Observatory in California.  He was the first person to realise the
true size of our Galaxy in 1918 while studying globular clusters, and he was the
first person to locate the centre of our Galaxy.  In 1920 he became Director of the 
Harvard College Observatory, and after 1925 he began studying the distribution of 
galaxies in the sky.  He was one of the first astronomers to believe in the
existence of superclusters (which he called <em>clouds</em> of galaxies), although he
was not aware that there were empty voids in the universe also.  Harlow also 
discovered (in 1938) the Sculptor and Fornax dwarf galaxies.  He died at the age
of 86 on October 20, 1972.

of galaxies in the central region of the supercluster.  Red, yellow and green
regions are areas with the largest number of galaxies.  This image was provided
