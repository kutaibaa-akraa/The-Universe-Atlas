<h1>The Leo Supercluster</h1>
<p>The Leo Supercluster is not a particularly famous supercluster.  This map 
below is a plot of the brightest galaxies (from the Principal Galaxies Catalogue)
in the vicinity of this supercluster.  The supercluster is about 440 million
light years from us, and at this distance a fairly weak supercluster like the
Leo supercluster is hard to see among all the foreground galaxies.  The nearer 
<a href="com.html" tppabs="http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/superc/com.html">Coma supercluster</a> is in this area as can be seen from the
presence of the large A1367 cluster, and even closer to us is the nearby Virgo 
cluster at the bottom left of the map.

<p>Below is a list of the major clusters in the Leo Supercluster.  The richest
cluster is probably the A1185 cluster.  Most of the other clusters are rather
poor clusters with a <em>richness class</em> of 0.  The cluster A1314 is also included
in this list although it lies some distance to the north of the supercluster and
it may not be a true member.

<h2>The Scientific Study of the Leo Supercluster</h2>
<p>There has been no proper scientific research conducted on this supercluster.
Occasionally, some of the clusters are studied, this is especially true of A1185,
which is probably the richest cluster in the supercluster.  The cluster was studied
by Mahdavi, Geller, Fabricant, Kurtz, Postman and McLean in

<p>Below is a picture of the centre of the A1185 cluster.  It is probably the
most important cluster in the Leo supercluster.  This cluster is about the same 
size as the Virgo cluster and has a similar number of galaxies.  The brightest 
galaxy here (at the top of the picture) is NGC3550.
