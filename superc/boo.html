<h1>The Boötes Superclusters</h1>
<p>There are two superclusters in Bootes within one billion light years.  The
nearest one is about 830 million light years away - the second one lies directly
behind it at a distance of about 1 billion light years.  This map shows all of 
the galaxies brighter than magnitude 17 (from the

in this part of the sky.  The locations of the major clusters of galaxies are 
marked.  On the right side of the map is the much closer Coma cluster (A1656), 
and on the left are some of the clusters in the <a href="cbo.html" tppabs="http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/superc/cbo.html">Corona Borealis
supercluster</a> which is probably connected to the two Bootes superclusters by a
wall of galaxies.

<p>Below is a list of the major clusters of galaxies in the two Bootes Superclusters.
The exact distance to one of these clusters (A1861) is currently uncertain and it
could be a background cluster.

<h2>The Boötes Void</h2>
<p>The Bootes superclusters are famous mainly because they lie next to (and
slightly behind) the Bootes void.  This void is one of the most famous voids in
the universe mainly because it was one of the first major voids discovered.  It
was discovered in 1981.  The centre of the void is about 700 million light years
from us (redshift 0.052) and it has a diameter of about 300 million light years.
</p>
<p>This map below is a plot of all the galaxies brighter than magnitude 17 in this
part of the sky.  The location of the Bootes void is marked.  The void contains
very few galaxies, although there are a lot of foreground galaxies between us and
the void.  This map shows how the void is bordered to the south and west by 
several major superclusters, including the Bootes superclusters to the southeast.

<p>Right - a slice of the universe which shows the Bootes Void.  This map is a 
plot of 3500 galaxies (from the HyperLeda Database) in the direction of the Bootes Void.
Our galaxy is at the bottom and the top of the map is 1 billion light years away.
The data is very incomplete beyond 500 million light years so the void is not very
prominant, but its location is marked.  Most of the galaxies located within the
area of the void are galaxies which lie above and below the void.</p>

<h2>The Scientific Study of the Boötes Superclusters</h2>
<p>There has been no scientific study of the superclusters in Bootes.  Although
these superclusters are much bigger than the Virgo supercluster, there are many
closer superclusters which are considered to be more interesting.

continued to be discovered, by 1997 a total of 60 Bootes Void galaxies were known.
This is still a very low number.  A normal region of the universe of this size

discovered are usually located near the edges of the void.
