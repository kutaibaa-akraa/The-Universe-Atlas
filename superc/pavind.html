<h1>The Pavo-Indus Supercluster</h1>
<p>The Pavo-Indus Supercluster is not regarded as a major supercluster.  It is not a
particularly dense concentration of galaxies and it doesn't contain any very rich
clusters of galaxies.  This map below shows the brightest galaxies (from the 
Principal Galaxies Catalogue) in this region of the sky.  The Pavo-Indus Supercluster
is faintly visible as a curving wall of galaxies that connects to the rich A3627 
cluster and ultimately to the <a href="cen.html" tppabs="http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/superc/cen.html">Centaurus supercluster</a>.

<p>Below is a list of clusters of galaxies in the vicinity of the Pavo-Indus 
Supercluster.  The three Abell clusters within this supercluster are A3656, A3698 
and A3742.  They are not impressive clusters of galaxies.  The most important 
cluster in this region of the sky is the major A3627 cluster which dominates this 
part of the universe (see the page on the <a href="cen.html" tppabs="http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/superc/cen.html">Centaurus supercluster</a>
for more information).

<p>Below are some other prominant groups of galaxies in this region.  Notice
that there are two separate groups of galaxies which are commonly called the
<em>Pavo cluster</em>.  The IC4765 group is the larger of the two Pavo clusters and
it may possibly be a richer group than the three Abell clusters within the
supercluster.

<h2>The Scientific Study of the Pavo-Indus Supercluster</h2>
<p>Very little information has been written about the Pavo-Indus supercluster.  It

<p>Above - the cluster A3742 which lies in the middle of the Pavo-Indus supercluster.
This is a typical example of an Abell cluster with a richness class of 0.  About 
twenty galaxies can be seen in this picture (visible as fuzzy oval patches) but most 
of them are very hard to distinguish from the foreground stars.  The two brightest
galaxies here are ESO 286-49 (centre) and NGC 7014 (left).
