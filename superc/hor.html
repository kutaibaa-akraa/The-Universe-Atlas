<h1>The Horologium Supercluster</h1>
<p>The Horologium Supercluster is a gigantic supercluster with a length of about
550 million light years.  This map shows every galaxy brighter than magnitude 17
(from the <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://leda.univ-lyon1.fr/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://leda.univ-lyon1.fr/'" tppabs="http://leda.univ-lyon1.fr/">HyperLeda</a> 
database) in this area of the sky.  All of the major clusters of galaxies in the
Horologium supercluster are marked.  The nearest part of this supercluster (mainly
the clusters near the bottom of the picture) is 700 million light years away but
the far end (mainly the clusters at the top) is 1.2 billion light years from us.
There are no other superclusters within a billion light years which are as big as
this.

<p>Below is a list of the major clusters of galaxies in and near the Horologium
Supercluster.  There are about forty clusters in this list, which is a much greater 
quantity than most other superclusters.  This list is probably not complete.  There
are a lot of other clusters in the Abell catalogue in this region of the sky which
do not have a published redshift and hence have an unknown distance - a few of these
clusters are probably also in the Horologium Supercluster.

<p>Below is a list of other major groups of galaxies in the vicinity of the
Horologium supercluster.  These are all groups which contain many tens of
galaxies but which were not significant enough to be included in the Abell
catalogue.  This is a fairly random selection, there are a lot of groups
in this area which do not have a published redshift.  The foreground groups
in this list are interesting because together with the A3144 and A3193
clusters they form part of a smaller supercluster in front of the Horologium
supercluster at a distance of 550 million light years (redshift 0.040).

<h2>A3128 - The Shapley 20 Cluster</h2>
<p>Below is a picture of the centre of the A3128 cluster.  This cluster was 
number twenty in a list of twenty-five rich clusters which Harlow Shapley 
published in 1933.  This cluster does not contain any of the gigantic elliptical
galaxies sometimes found at the centre of rich clusters although there are
certainly a lot of large galaxies here.  This is the richest cluster of galaxies
in the Horologium supercluster and one of the richest clusters within a billion 
light years from us.

PGC 12997) are foreground galaxies 250 million light years in front of the cluster.
But most of the galaxies here (including IC1945) are in the cluster.

<p>The Horologium supercluster is a remarkable supercluster.  It is one of
the largest and richest superclusters known.  However, since 1984 it has been 
completely ignored.  Not many astronomers have heard of the Horologium supercluster
and many of those who have heard of it seem to be unaware of how large it is.  
A few astronomers are aware of its size, but noone has studied it in detail.  
This web page seems to be the first serious (although brief) attempt to describe
the entire supercluster.

<p>Below - a picture of the centre of the A3158 cluster of galaxies.  This is another
of the very rich clusters of galaxies in the Horologium supercluster and it lies at
exactly the same distance as the A3128 cluster.  The three largest elliptical galaxies
in this picture are (from right to left) PGC 13641, ESO 156-8, and PGC 13679.
