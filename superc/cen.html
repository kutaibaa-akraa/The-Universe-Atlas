<h1>The Centaurus Supercluster</h1>
<p>The Centaurus supercluster is the nearest large supercluster. This map below 
is a plot of the brightest galaxies (from the Principal Galaxies Catalogue) in this 
area of the sky.  The supercluster is a fairly obvious structure in the middle of 
the map.  Note that the plane of the Milky Way cuts its way through this region of 
the sky - any photographs of galaxies in the area of the Centaurus Supercluster are 
usually heavily contaminated with large numbers of foreground stars.

<p>Below is a list of the major clusters of galaxies in the vicinity of the Centaurus 
Supercluster.  The dominant cluster in the supercluster is A3526 - it is known as
the Centaurus cluster.  It only received a <em>richness class</em> of 0 in the Abell catalogue
although it is probably better to regard it as a class 1 cluster.  A3565, on the other
hand, is a much poorer cluster and probably should be regarded as class 0.  Also near
the Centaurus supercluster is the Hydra cluster (A1060) and the very heavily obscured
Norma cluster (A3627) which may be one of the most important clusters in the nearby 
universe.

of the supercluster showing all of the major groups listed in the table above.
The Centaurus supercluster is a long supercluster that stretches away from us.
A3581 is the most distant of the clusters and is 300 million light years from
us, although at that distance it is hard to say whether it is actually part of 
the supercluster.</p>

<h2>A3526 - The Centaurus Cluster</h2>
<p>The Centaurus cluster - A3526 - is the nearest cluster of galaxies listed in 
the Abell catalogue (which doesn't include the Virgo cluster).  The cluster contains 
a similar number of galaxies to the Virgo and Hydra clusters.  This photograph 
shows a two-degree-wide area of the sky centred on the cluster.  There are 
thousands of foreground stars in this picture, but the brightest galaxies are 
clearly visible as the various white blobs.  The brightest galaxy is 
NGC 4696 - a massive elliptical galaxy.

<p>Below is a map of the Centaurus cluster.  This map shows the positions of 118
of the brightest galaxies in this cluster.  Some of these galaxies are actually
background galaxies that form part of a separate cluster that lies 60 million light
years behind the Centaurus cluster.  This includes NGC 4709, which is the second
brightest galaxy in this region.  It is perhaps best to regard the Centaurus cluster
as two separate clusters superimposed on each other.

that there is a large scale motion of galaxies towards the Centaurus region of
the sky.  They called this region the <em>Great Attractor</em>.  Unfortunately the exact
location of the object pulling the galaxies is very near to the plane of the
Galaxy and hidden by the foreground gas, dust and stars.

a paper</a> in 1996 that there was a large cluster of galaxies in this
region which had been previously ignored.  This is the A3627 cluster (or the
<em>Norma cluster</em>).  Careful study of this cluster showed that it is a massive
cluster of galaxies similar in scale to the Coma or Perseus clusters.  It is
therefore the nearest of the very rich clusters which contain thousands of
galaxies.  It is not an easy cluster to see, and large-angle photographs of 
this region usually show immense numbers of foreground stars and not much else.

<br />
<p>Left: A photograph of a 2 degree wide area of the sky centred on the A3627 galaxy
cluster reveals little more than the stars of the Milky Way.  But if we plot onto 
the image the locations of strong X-ray sources (in green) from the ROSAT All-Sky 
Survey, a major stucture is revealed.  This is the A3627 cluster.

<br class="spacer" />

<p>
This is not quite the end of the Great Attractor story.  Although the A3627 
cluster is a massive cluster, it may not be massive enough to cause so many 
galaxies to move towards it.  There is a possibility that there may be a second 
rich cluster even closer to the plane of the Galaxy and even harder to see.
