<h1>The Hydra Supercluster</h1>
<p>Together with the Centaurus supercluster, the Hydra supercluster is one of the
two superclusters that are closest to the Virgo supercluster.  The Hydra supercluster
is about 100 million light years long, and it contains only one rich galaxy cluster - 
A1060 - also known as the Hydra cluster.  This map below is a plot of every galaxy 
brighter than magnitude 16 (from the Principal Galaxies Catalogue) in the region of 
the sky centred on the Hydra supercluster.  It is not an impressive supercluster, the 
only prominant features in this supercluster are the Hydra cluster and the rather 
smaller Antlia cluster.

<p>Below is a list of the major clusters of galaxies in the Hydra Supercluster.  Like
the Virgo supercluster, the Hydra supercluster contains only one rich cluster: A1060
or the <em>Hydra cluster</em>.  It has a <em>richness class</em> of 1, which means that it contains
a similar number of galaxies to the Virgo cluster.

Supercluster.  These groups typically contain only about 10 large galaxies each.  
The only exception is the Antlia cluster which probably contains about 30 large 
galaxies.

<p>Below is a three-dimensional map of the Hydra supercluster.  This map is an
actual plot of the 250 largest galaxies in the supercluster.  At the centre of the
supercluster lies the dominant Hydra cluster - A1060.  The nearest part of the 
supercluster to us is the region at the top-left where a lot of the other prominant 
groups of galaxies are.

<h2>A1060 - The Hydra Cluster</h2>
<p>Together with the Virgo cluster and the Centaurus cluster (A3526), the Hydra
cluster is one of the three largest clusters of galaxies within 200 million light
years.  Below is a photograph of the Hydra cluster.  The galaxies here are visible as 
the various white blobs.  Because the cluster is spread across 2 degrees of the sky 
there are a lot of faint foreground stars in this image.  The bright orange star at the 
centre of the picture is HR4162 - a fifth magnitude red giant star 480 light years away.

<p>Right: this is a map of the Hydra cluster.  This map shows the positions of 74 
of the brightest galaxies in and around this cluster.  The three dominant galaxies at 
the centre of the Hydra cluster are the two large elliptical galaxies NGC3309 and 
NGC3311 and the large spiral galaxy NGC3312.  All three galaxies have a diameter of 
about 150 thousand light years.</p>

<h2>The Scientific Study of the Hydra Supercluster</h2>
<p>Because it is not a major supercluster, the Hydra supercluster has not received a
huge amount of attention.  The Hydra supercluster has usually been studied 
together with its larger neighbour the <a href="cen.html" tppabs="http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/superc/cen.html">Centaurus supercluster</a>.  A typical example is 
  <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1986AJ.....91....6D  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1986AJ.....91....6D'" tppabs="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1986AJ.....91....6D">
a paper</a> by Costa, Numes, Pellegrini, Willmer, Chincarini, and Cowan who studied 
the distribution of galaxies in this region of the sky.
</p>
<p>
However most authors who have studied both the Hydra and Centaurus superclusters
agree that these two superclusters are separate structures.  In a 
  <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1987AJ.....93.1338D  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1987AJ.....93.1338D'" tppabs="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1987AJ.....93.1338D">
second paper</a>, da Costa, Willmer, Pellegrini, and Chincarini make it quite clear that 
they regard these two superclusters as seperate.  The two superclusters are not 
unlinked however, they both connect to the Virgo supercluster and it is quite common 
to see this entire region referred to as the <em>Virgo-Hydra-Centaurus supercluster</em>.
</p>
<p>
Because it is one of the nearest rich clusters of galaxies, the Hydra cluster has
been studied on many occasions.  A typical example is 
  <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1989A%26AS...77..237R  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1989A%26AS...77..237R'" tppabs="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1989A%26AS...77..237R">

Although it is a poorer cluster, the Antlia cluster is also studied sometimes.

<h3>The Antlia cluster</h3>
<img src="antlia.jpg" tppabs="http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/superc/antlia.jpg" class="floatleft" width="400" height="400" alt="The Antlia cluster - from the Digitized Sky Survey" />
<br />
<p>Although it is the second richest cluster in the Hydra supercluster, the Antlia
cluster is not nearly as impressive as the Hydra cluster.  It is a similar cluster
to the Fornax cluster.
</p>
<p>Like the Hydra cluster, the Antlia cluster does not photograph very well.  The
galaxies here are spread across 1 degree of the sky, so there are a lot of foreground
stars in this image.  The large central galaxy is NGC3268 - a massive elliptical
galaxy.</p>
