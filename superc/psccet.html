<h1>The Pisces-Cetus Superclusters</h1>
<p>The superclusters in the Pisces-Cetus area of the sky are very large structures
that together stretch across a billion light years of space (and 50 degrees of the 
sky).  At an average distance of 800 million light years, they are also very faint.
On this plot of galaxies brighter than magnitude 16 (from the

the superclusters are hard to see because of the huge quantities of foreground 
galaxies.  The major clusters of galaxies which are marked on this plot reveal the
true extent of these superclusters.

<p>Below is a list of the major clusters of galaxies in the Pisces-Cetus Superclusters.
These are the clusters in the three main supercluster regions.  There are several
other major clusters of galaxies not included in this list which can also be found
in this region.  The Pisces-Cetus region of the sky is rich in galaxy clusters.

<p>This is a map of the supergalactic plane out to a distance of 1 billion light
years.  Plotted onto this map are all of the rich clusters of galaxies which lie 
near this plane.  The Pisces-Cetus superclusters (marked in blue, yellow and
green) form long wall structures across a billion light years of space.
Not shown on this map are the thousands of smaller groups of galaxies which are
also found in these superclusters.

light years away.  This is one of many rich clusters of galaxies in the Pisces-Cetus
region.  The bright central galaxy (actually two very close galaxies) in this picture
is IC 77.
